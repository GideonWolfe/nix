# Packages

One central location for all packages that I want installed on the system. Currently being installed via `home-manager`.

## Custom

All packages that I have manually packages. They are imported by relevant package lists in the subdirectories of `packages`, ie `adsb-deku.nix` is imported through `radio.nix`.


## Package Lists

`full.nix` will install ALL packages, building a full and complete system.
