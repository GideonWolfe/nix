# Roles

Each one of the directories in `roles` represents a function or attribute of a host, that may not apply to every system. 

For example, a system with lower-spec hardware may not need gaming or music production related software and configurations.

It also lets me easily toggle groups of functionality off/on easily. The `monitoring` stack that should run on each system to collect metrics, can be disabled on a per-system basis, ie for testing.
