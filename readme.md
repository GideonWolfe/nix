## Repo Structure

## Initial steps required for setup
    * Calendars and Contacts
        * `vdirsyncer discover calendar_gmail` to initialize auth to vdirsyncer
        * `vdirsyncer discover contacts_gmail` to initialize auth to vdirsyncer
        * there's a couple things you have to agree too, like creating the local calendar files, how to automate this?

    * Set up browser plugins
        * ~/.config/darkreader.darkreader.json needs to be manually imported via darkreader settings (FF and Chromium)
        * New Tab Override (FF) and New Tab URL (Chromium) needs to be set to point at http://localhost:9876



## Real Time Audio (for music production)

https://github.com/musnix/musnix

## Refactoring

* move the git commit script thats floating around
* move the service definition for the startpage into the user dir, its ugly defined in system and reaching into hardcoded user dir for config files

## Add theme to cli-visualizer

command is `vis`, takes a config file with a theme 

https://github.com/dpayne/cli-visualizer?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration

## Add custom icons of some sort

## Change workspace icon when new window opened

like if I click a link and it opens a tab in FF in another workspace, that workspace icon should get a highlight.
I think its called urgent or something


## Add theme to audacity
seems to have a "Custom" option for theme

## Configure spicetify

https://github.com/the-argus/spicetify-nix lets you specify custom colors in nix

Already installed this, works well with preset themes. Now need to make a stylix theme


## Hardware only stuff (can't really config in VM)

* Multi monitor outputs
* Bluetooth (should be configured already)
* Virtual machines (should be configured already)
* Backlight control (already have module but need to test)
* Hibernation/sleep

## Seahorse won't import SSH key

```
Could not display ‚Äú<key_name>‚Äù
Reason:	Unrecognized or unsupported data.
```

is it because the keys aren't in `.ssh`? I don't think that's been an issue before

## Emoji fonts rendering as colored emoji

I have emoji font specified in `stylix` as `Symbola`, and `fonts.fontconfig.defaultFonts.emoji = ["Symbola"]`

I have `symbola` and `noto-fonts-monochrome-emoji` installed, which both seem to be showing in `gucharmap`

It's just not changing the system emoji font :(

## Qt Theming

Ongoing discussion on Stylix github, how to access these new features?

https://github.com/danth/stylix/pull/367

## Build UI Elements

### Window switcher

to switch between windows on all workspaces

### Fancy logout/shortcut/power menu

on old system it was build with rofi, but this will change

### Set up Hyprland

hard to do in a VM since it runs like shite

### Improve waybar media playing module

maybe this third party one https://github.com/raffaem/waybar-mediaplayer
or just hack on it

### Add waybar desktop notification toggle 

maybe adapt https://github.com/vkraven/swankybar to toggle notifications instead of adaptive sync

## Misc

* `cava` continues to hear audio even when system vol is muted
